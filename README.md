# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project implements a machine learning system to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression. It tackles the challenge of financial fraud by analyzing historical transaction data to learn patterns that distinguish legitimate purchases from fraudulent activity. The system can be integrated into real-time fraud detection pipelines to flag suspicious transactions for further investigation.

#Key Features:
#Logistic Regression: Employs Logistic Regression, a robust classification algorithm, to predict the probability of a transaction being fraudulent based on its features.
#Fraud Detection: Identifies potentially fraudulent transactions by analyzing various factors, such as transaction amount, location, time, and cardholder behavior.
#Python Implementation: Leverages the power and versatility of Python for data analysis, model development, and deployment.
